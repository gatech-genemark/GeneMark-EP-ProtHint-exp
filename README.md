## Overview

This repository contains documentation of experiments, data and results for
ProtHint and GeneMark-EP/EP+ projects.

## Program Versions

All experiments in this folder were run with GeneMark-ES/EP version `5.57_lic` and ProtHint version
`v2.3.0`. To reproduce the experiments, install these versions of the programs into
`bin/gmes` and `bin/ProtHint` folders.

Version of DIAMOND and Spaln within ProtHint were `0.9.24` and `2.3.3d`, respectively.

GeneMark suite is available at: http://topaz.gatech.edu/GeneMark/license_download.cgi
ProtHint is available at: https://github.com/gatech-genemark/ProtHint/releases

## Example of a full run

To run an entire GeneMark-EP+ pipeline with a single command, including ProtHint, use:

    cd full_run_example
    ../bin/gmes/gmes_petap.pl --seq ../Drosophila_melanogaster/data/genome.fasta.masked \
        --EP --dbep ../Drosophila_melanogaster/data/family_excluded.fa --verbose --cores=16

If the matching version of GeneMark-EP+ was used, the result should match the result
stored in `full_run_example/expected_genemark.gtf`. Follow the instructions in `Drosophila_melanogaster/data`
folder to prepare genome and protein data.

This example uses D. melanogaster with proteins from species outside of the same
taxonomical family.

In the rest of the experiments, GeneMark-ES, ProtHint, and GeneMark-EP+ are run separately
to evaluate different aspects of the programs. However, all results in
`species/{}_excluded/EP/plus` can be reproduced with the same single command which was
used to generate the result in `full_run_example` folder.

## Folder structure

The core folder structure for all tested species looks as follows:

Specific ProtHint/GeneMark-EP folders may contain extra folders with
additional experiments. In such cases, the experiments are documented within
the species README file.
